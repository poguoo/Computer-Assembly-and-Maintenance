This is the key knowledge point that I have compiled by myself in my daily teaching work for students to use. The textbook is Duan Xin's "Computer Assembly and Maintenance" (Fifth Edition) published by the Electronic Industry Press.

这是我日常教学工作中自己整理的供学生使用的知识要点。教材是电子工业出版社的《计算机组装与维护》（第五版）段欣。

I reorganized some of the chapters in the book myself. Some charts have been made to make it easy to understand. Of course, some previous materials were also used.

我自己重新规整了书中的一些章节。制作了一些方便理解的图表。当然也使用了一些前人的素材。

Hopefully, these things will be helpful to the people who use this book.

希望这些东西能对使用这本书的人有所帮助。

Please don't file issues to me for the wrong part of the knowledge.

请不要对知识的错误部分给我提交Issues。
